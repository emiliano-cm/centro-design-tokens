# centro-design-tokens

This repo contains the Design Tokens that make up the foundations of the products @ Tribal. (Currently only used by the crypto team)

These tokens are managed and pushed from Figma using the [Tokens Studio](https://tokens.studio) plugin.
CSS variables are then automatically generated using [Token Transformer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/token-transformer) and [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/).

For more information read the ['Tokens Studio for Figma' Docs](https://docs.tokens.studio/sync/github)
